# Cheats
Or as I like to call them, bypasses.

## Chess Game bypass
For this, go to [Lichess's Board editor](https://lichess.org/editor).

Place a few of your pieces, fill in atleast 1 row into the chessboard.
Look down where it says FEN.

Now you want to copy the row you filled in's FEN information.

Example:

Open up the file called [chess.json](chess.json) in this repository and press Control + F, then paste in your copied fen number, you should see the text you need to type in on the `sol` field.
